#### `@angular-ru/common/webworker`

-   `WebWorkerThreadService` - Web workers allow you to run CPU-intensive computations in a background thread, freeing
    the main thread to update the user interface. If you find your application performs a lot of computations, such as
    generating CAD drawings or doing heavy geometrical calculations, using web workers can help increase your
    application's performance.

```ts
@Component({
    // ...
    providers: [WebWorkerThreadService]
})
export class MyComponent {
    constructor(private readonly worker: WebWorkerThreadService) {}
}
```
